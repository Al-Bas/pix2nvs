# PIX2NVS: A Neuromorphic Vision Sensor Emulator 

Here we provide a straight-out-of-the-box implementation of **PIX2NVS**, a tool for converting pixel frames to brightness spike events generated by neuromorphic vision sensors (e.g. DAVIS-240). 

A full description of the operation of the tool provided here can be found in our paper:

If you use this tool, please cite the paper above. This tool is provided under the [MIT license].

# Building from source
All dependencies are located in the source folder. To build from source, change your working directory to this repository's home folder and run:

```bash
g++ -o pix2nvs src/*.cpp  # to build from source  
./pix2nvs # to run using default parameters
```

##### Command-line options:

Option | Description
--- | ---
--reference or -r | set to (1, 2, or 3) to specify one of the reference frame update methods.
--mexevents or -m | will specify the maximum number of events generated between two frames
--blocksize or -b | will set the block size for local inhibition
--adaptive  or -a | sets the co-efficient shift for adaptive thresholding, set to (0) to disable
--help      or -h | show usage syntax and parameter description

The reference frame update option can be set to any of the following:

r | Reference Frame Update Method
--- | ---
1 | copy last frame from source
2 | update reference frame using only generated events, with history decay
3 | update reference frame using only generated events, without history decay 


# Example Usage

To extract events from videos located in the input folder:

```bash  
./pix2nvs -m 3 -a 0.05 -b 0 # to run using default parameters
```
All outputs will be located in the folder "Events". The output from pix2nvs using these parameters is visualized in the following figure:
